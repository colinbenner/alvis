AlgorithmEditorCompletionProcessor_contextInformationFor=Context Information for 
AlgorithmEditorCompletionProcessor_newLineSomeInfo=\n Some Info here
AlgorithmEditorCompletionProcessor_additionalInformationFor=Additional Information for: 
AlgorithmErrorMarker_ArgumentNumberEx=Function {0} called at {1}:{2} with the wrong number of arguments ({3} instead of the expected {4}).
AlgorithmErrorMarker_ArgumentTypeEx=Function {0} called at {1}:{2} got an argument with the wrong type: argument #{3} is of type {4} but should be of type {5}.
AlgorithmErrorMarker_DuplicateDeclaration=Trying to declare the identifier {0} at position {1}:{2} which has already been declared.
AlgorithmErrorMarker_InvalidAssignment=Tried to assign to {0}  at {1}:{2} which is a function call and can thus not be assigned to.
AlgorithmErrorMarker_InvalidNonVoidReturn=Trying to return non-void result {0}:{1} from void function {2}.
AlgorithmErrorMarker_InvalidReturnType=Trying to return value {0} from function {1} at {2}:{3} which has type {4} where an expression of type {5} was expected.
AlgorithmErrorMarker_InvalidStatement=Tried to use expression {0} where a statement was expected at {1}:{2}.
AlgorithmErrorMarker_InvalidVoidReturn=Trying to return from function {0} at {1}:{2} without a return value where a return value of type {3} was expected. 
AlgorithmErrorMarker_MismatcheTreeNode=MismatchedTreeNode at {0}:{1}. This indicates a severe error in the compiler.\n{2}
AlgorithmErrorMarker_NoSuchBinaryOperator=Using non-existent operator {0} with a left argument of type {1} and a right argument type {2} at {3}:{4}.
AlgorithmErrorMarker_NoSuchUnaryOperator=Using non-existent operator {0} for arguments of type {1} at {2}:{3}.
AlgorithmErrorMarker_NotAFunction=Trying to call {0} at {1}:{2} which has type {3} and therefore is not a function.
AlgorithmErrorMarker_NotAnArray=Trying to index {0} at {1}:{2} which has type {3} and therefore is not an array.
AlgorithmErrorMarker_NoViableAlt=Found no viable alternative when parsing at {0}:{1}.
AlgorithmErrorMarker_TypeMismatch=Found expression {0} at {1}:{2} which has type {3} where an expression of type {4} was expected.
AlgorithmErrorMarker_UnknownError=Error at {0}:{1}: {2}
AlgorithmErrorMarker_UnknownIdentifier=Found identifier {0} at {1}:{2} which was not declared before being used in the current scope.
AlgorithmErrorMarker_UnknownMember=Found access to member {0} of class {1} at {2}:{3}. Such a member does not exist.
AlgorithmErrorMarker_UnknownOperator=Found operator {0} at {1}:{2} with argument of type {3} which is not defined.
