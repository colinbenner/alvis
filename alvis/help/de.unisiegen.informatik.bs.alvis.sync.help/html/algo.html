<h1>Write an algorithm</h1>
If the user has created an example using the scenario editor, is still missing, the
algorithm / algorithms. For each process, an algorithm is defined, he will run in the
Run. As the editor and its operation in Section Alvis -> write algorithms described
will be omitted at this point.

<h2>Beispiel</h2>
The following example shows the algorithms for the well-known example from the semaphore
section, with two processes that are strictly alternateling their output.

<pre>
main(Scenario s) begin
	Thread List tl = s.threads;
	for Thread t in tl: begin
		t.start(t.algo),
	end
end

Prozess1(Semaphore s1, Semaphore s2) begin
	while true: begin
		s1.P();
		print("Prozess 1");
		s2.V();
	end
end

Prozess2(Semaphore s1, Semaphore s2) begin
	while true: begin
		s2.P();
		print("Prozess 2");
		s1.V();
	end
end
</pre>
