<h1>Condition</h1>
A condition is a condition variable that is used in a monitor called synchronization
structure. A monitor cannot deadlock by jamming operations in the wrong order.
A condition also knows two operations. The operation signal indicates that a condition
is met, the wait operation waits for the fulfillment of this.

<h2>Functionality</h2>
The monitor consists of the operations and resources, which should be synced and the
conditions needed for this. The operations that are defined in the monitor are
automatically under mutual exclusion.<br />
When a process calls the wait operation, it releases the monitor and waits for another
process invokes the signal operation on the same condition. During this time the process
is blocked and the condition manages it in a queue.<br />
If the signal operation is called, the processes that are waiting for the fulfillment
of this condition wake up an are ready to run when the process that invoked the signal
operation releases the monitor.
This plugin contains a replica of the codition construct, which contains the methods wait()
and signal().

<h2>Example</h2>

In the following example there are two processes that may put only strictly alternately a
message on the console. This synchronization is possible using a monitor with two
conditions by any process waiting for the condition for an issue and fulfilled this
condition for the other process.<br />
