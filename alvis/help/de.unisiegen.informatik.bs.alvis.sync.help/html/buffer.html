<h1>Buffer</h1>
A buffer is a data type that allows multiple processes to communicate and cooperate with
each other. The buffer is a so-called "critical section" that the must never be used by
more than one process simultaneously to avoid errors. This condition can be synchronized
by different mechanisms and is a popular example of the synchronization process. A buffer
in the real world has only limited space, so that must also be prevented write access to
a full buffer and reads from an empty buffer.<br />
For these examples are visualized with Alvis, this plugin contains a replica of a buffer
with selectable capacity. To insert and delete of content are the methods insert() and
remove() are available.
