<h1>Semaphore</h1>
A semaphore is a data structure that is used to manage limited, countable resources. A
semaphore consists essentially of an integer variable whose value is the number of
remaining resources is. It provides two operations are available, one to reserve a resource
(called P-operation) and another (called V-operation) to release a resource.

<h2>Functionality</h2>
The semaphore is initialized in most cases with the number of available resources.<br />
When a process wants to use the resource, he must prove by calling the P-operation and
receives this access if no other process is accessing it more. The P-operation reduces
the count in the semaphore by 1. If the counter is by this operation reduces to a value
less than 0, then the calling process is blocked until a resource has been released.<br />
If the use of the resource is completed, the process calls on the V-operation. This
operation increases the count in the semaphore by 1, it indicates that now an additional
resource has been released. If there are any processes that were previously blocked by
the semaphore, they are notified and can continue their progress.

<h2>Example</h2>
In the following example there are two threads that may print only strictly alternately
a message on the console. This synchronization is possible using two semaphores, since
each process locks  for themselves and releasing them to the other thread.<br />
The required semaphores:<br />
<span style="font-family: Courier New">
<pre>
Semaphore s1 = 1; //semaphore for the first thread. Can start
Semaphore s2 = 0; //semaphore for den second thread. Has to wait for thread 1
</pre>
</span><br />

Thread 1:
<span style="font-family: Courier New">
<pre>
while (true) {
	s1.P();
	print("Thread 1");
	s2.V();
}
</pre>
</span><br />

Thread 2:
<span style="font-family: Courier New">
<pre>
while (true) {
	s2.P();
	print("Thread 2");
	s1.V();
}
</pre>
</span>
