<h1>Prozess</h1>
A thread represents a running program. Because a computer is to execute multiple
threads "simultaneously", the CPU pauses after a while the running thread and
calls another. Thus, a quasi-parallel execution occurs on systems whose CPU count is far
below the number of threads.<br />
Because a thread has no influence when it allocates the CPU computing time or beyond, but
he may have access to various resources, access must be synchronized to these resources.<br />
For visualization of threads this plugin provides the data type Thread, each performing
a user-defined algorithm.
