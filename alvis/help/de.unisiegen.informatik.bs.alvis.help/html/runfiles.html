<h1>Run Files</h1>
Run Files are a means of controlling how an algorithm is used on an example.<br/>
<br/>
In order to do so you chose an algorithm file from the current Alvis workspace. Furthermore you add an example file on which the algorithm is used. This can be a graph or a syncronisation problem oder any other datatype provided by an Alvis plug-in.<br/><br/>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">

<tr>
      <th ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1"> <P CLASS="Para">Symbol/Tab</P></TH>
      <th ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1"> <P CLASS="Para">Description</P></th>

		<td>Start the run with the given parameters.</td>
	</tr>
	<TR>
		<TD align="center">Start Points</TD>
		<TD><strong>Random:</strong>Alvis decides, which parameters are handed over to the algorithm. Example: Start and end node of a graph algorithm.<br/>
		    <strong>Decide:</strong>The user decides. As soon as the run starts, Alvis asks for the parameters.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD align="center">Decision Points</TD>
		<TD>Every time the algorithm has to process an unordered set of data (example: adjacent nodes of node in a graph), the user has to decide, in what order the data is used.<br/>
		<strong>Random:</strong> Alvis decides randomly.<br/>
		<strong>Once:</strong>The user orders the data belonging to each decision points once. These decisions will not be delete when undoing algorithm steps.<br/>
		<strong>Always: </strong>Alvis asks for a decision every time and decisions will be deleted by going backwards.</TD>
